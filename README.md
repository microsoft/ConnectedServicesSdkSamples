# ConnectedServicesSdkSamples
======================================

This repository contains everything you need to get started building a Connected Services extension.

The repository is made up of 2 top-level directories:

* **Externals**.  Contains the latest Connected Services binaries that you can reference, and the
  latest VSIX installers for both the Connected Services core and the Salesforce extension.

* **src**.  Contains several sample providers for the 3 UI Configurators (SinglePage, Grid & Wizard) as well as Design Time Auth and Handlers for adding files to your project.  You can use these to jumpstart your
  development, or as a reference.
